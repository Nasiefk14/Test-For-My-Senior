## Task one:
### Write me button component library
I should be able to use the same button component anywhere and pass a variation prop to it
I need these variations: Primary, Secondary, Danger and Warning

When I click it, it should throw and alert on my screen with the following text:
'The Warning Button was Clicked!'

TS isn't necessary, but is encouraged

## Task two:
### Set up a simple app that only has a text input
The input should be debounced and only set a state in my store after 500ms when I am done typing

## Task three:
### Use this API: 
```
https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
```
### I need an app that fetches the list of non-alcoholic cocktails: 
```
https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?a=Non_Alcoholic
```
It should only show ten entries from the cocktails retrieved
Further functionality should be that I can favourite and delete a cocktail from the list
When I favourite it, it should have a gold border and a gold star added in the top right corner


You can add all these tasks in one app if you would like, just for time saving purposes
